## Use with Jenkins Plot Plugin

A common use-case is to plot method and field counts across builds.  The [Jenkins Plot plugin][0] is a general-purpose tool that graphs per-build scalar values through time.  It reads java .properties files, CSV files, and XML files.  Dexcount generates two files for each variant - a full package list, and a summary CSV file.  The summary file is usable as-is with the Jenkins Plot Plugin.  You can find it in `app/build/outputs/variant.csv` (note the `.csv` extension).

Consult the plugin documentation for details on how to configure it.

## Use with Team City

Common case is to enable integration with `teamCityIntegration` option and add custom statistic graphs in Team City. Key name is generated by pattern `DexCount_${variant}_ClassCount`, `DexCount_${variant}_MethodCount` and `DexCount_${variant}_FieldCount`

_Technically special strings like_ `##teamcity[buildStatisticValue key='DexCount_universalDebug_MethodCount' value='62362']` _will be printed._ 

[More about integration in Team City doc][1]

If you have multiple products within one project using Dexcount, the default stat names will conflict with each other.  In this case, the `teamCitySlug` configuration option can be useful.  It is a string that, if specified, will be added to stat names according to the following scheme: `DexCount_${teamCitySlug}_${variant}_${statName}`.  Note that you can assign a dynamically-evaluated property, e.g. `teamCitySlug = project.name`.
